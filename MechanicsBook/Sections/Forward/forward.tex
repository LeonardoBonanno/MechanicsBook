Hello. My name is Leonardo Bonanno. As of this writing, I am a high-school student at Gulliver Preparatory School in Miami, Florida. When I was in 9th grade, I wanted to learn about physics. However, I found myself bored with thoughtless problems that did not help when I had to solve difficult problems. Anyone can plug in numbers into equations, but understanding these equations is much more difficult and much more powerful. So, throughout this book, I hope to equip you with the tools to not only do well on the AP Physics C exam but to understand the tools of elementary physics and the beauty of the subjects. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy this book.
