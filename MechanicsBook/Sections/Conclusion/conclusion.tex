Now that you have completed the book I hope that you are prepared for the Physics C: Mechanics exam. I also hope that you can better appreciate the joy of physics and understand the subtleties of the subject. I hope you will be encouraged to learn more. We have learned a lot of interesting things, but of course, there is so much more that we can do. There is a lot left for you(and for me), to learn. Thank you for taking the time to read the book, and I wish you well.
